When we want to google some fintech related companies, we will probably get results like the picture below.
When we open these links, these web pages only contain some basic information of these fintech companies and some descriptions about the quality of the companies. But it's clear that some professional investors and potential competitors want to see more than that.

In our app, when you search for fintech, we use jina neural search framework to display the most relevant companies, and at the same time, we also display company size information (employees + revenue) and company growth data for these companies, We partnered with BrightQuery to obtain this information from government documents. Our clients use company search to enrich the lists of existing companies they are already tracking and to find new companies that are not on their radar.
