# Personalized Investment Tool

## Background  
#### ---Capstone project sponsered by Fintent

"Fintent produces standard and custom signals for VC & PE firms that help them effectively deploy capital. We help by uncovering new investment ideas and prioritizing outreach to ensure you don't miss out on lucrative deals.

Do you spend too much time pulling data from different sources for your sourcing and deal origination?
With Fintent's Company Search, you can get reports of companies matching your investment criteria with all of the relevant data in one place. We'll create industry tags for you and append the report with firmographic info, funding data, behavioral/predictive signals, and contact data.

For the convenience of our clients, we plan to develop a real-time interactive web service based on the existing reporting system. our clients can make real-time and personalized enquiries."

## Introduction
This project aims to develop an App to help users find relevant companies to invest in a specific investment criterion. Other than other existing searches which return millions of results with too much noise, our App provides users with a more personalized experience by offering several filter options and models and returning a small number of high potential companies for users to do investment research on. With this APP, you can better understand your company lists and discover new companies matching your investment profile. 

## Example
#### Google result
When we want to google some small private fintech related companies, we will probably get results like the picture below.
When we open these links, these web pages only contain some basic information of these fintech companies and some descriptions about the quality of the companies. But it's clear that some professional investors and potential competitors want to see more than that.

#### Our APP result
In our app, when you search for fintech, we use jina neural search framework to display the most relevant companies, and at the same time, we also display company size information (employees + revenue) and company growth data for these companies, We partnered with BrightQuery to obtain this information from government documents. Our clients use company search to enrich the lists of existing companies they are already tracking and to find new companies that are not on their radar.
